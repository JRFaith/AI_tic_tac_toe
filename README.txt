Call overseer.py to start the game, it will run through the game 400,000 times and learn how to play tic-tac-toe

In the 'goes second' folder there is a more refined version, it is more advanced and has better learning capabilities. Again, call overseer.py to play the game, it will run through the same number of games, then run through another 100,000 to trim off all dead branches and achieve an average non-loss rate of 98%

Overseer.py, in each respective folder, handles the playing of the game. Pick the location that you want to go to, if it is not open or is not valid the game will ask you to repeat your input.

The first folder has the computer going first, the second folder 'goes second' has the computer going second while you get to play first. As mentioned this second folder contains a more advanced and polished version of learning.

Code is a little messy, I plan on cleaning it up after checkers is done
